    "The book written by George Polya in 1995, and entitled *How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method*, discusses in depth the main steps followed to solve mathematical problems. However, these steps are quite general and can be used to *solve computational problems* too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main steps:\n",
    "1. Understand the problem\n",
    "2. Devise a plan\n",
    "3. Carry out the plan\n",
    "4. Look back\n",

    "Strategies to apply in steps 1 and 2:\n",

    "- What do I know about the problem?\n",
    "- What is the information that I have to process in order the find the solution?\n",
    "- What sort of special cases exist?\n",
    "- What does the solution look like?\n",
    "- Can you think of two similar problems? (**never reinvent the wheel**)\n",
    "- How will I recognize that I have found the solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "An important strategy is **Divide and Conquer (D&C)**:\n",

    "We can be rewrite as: $f(x) = x^2 - N$, and thus our problem is equivalent to compute the zero of $f(x)$, because finding the *zero* of $f(x)$ corresponds to finding the **square root** of $N$.\n",
