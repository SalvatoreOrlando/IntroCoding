    "# Syntax of Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "We almost always need the ability to check Boolean conditions,  and change the behavior of the program accordingly. *Conditional statements* (also called *Selection statement*) give us this ability. The simplest form is the <tt>if</tt> statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        print('the condition is True')\n",
    "        print('x is positive')\n",
    "```         \n",
    "The Boolean expression after <tt>if</tt> is called the *condition*, which *must end with a colon* **':'** char. \n",
    "Then we have an **indented body**, which is a *block of statements* containing any number of statements.\n",
    "By convention, indentation is always four spaces, but the *editor* indents automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "About the semantics of <tt>if</tt>, if the condition is *True*, the *indented block* runs.  Otherwise, nothing happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in *python* the blocks are identified by **indented and aligned statements**, and this differs from other programming languages, where the blocks are identified by couples of curly brackets <tt>{ ... }</tt>, or couple of specific statements <tt>begin ... end</tt>, without forcing programmers to indent and align blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the designer of Python tried to force programmers to produce code that emphasises **readability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second form of conditionals is the <tt>if-else</tt> statement, or *alternative execution*. In this case  there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one runs.  The syntax looks like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if x % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print('the first branch was taken.')\n",
    "        print('x is even')\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print('x is odd')\n",
    "```        \n",
    "If the remainder when <tt>x</tt> is divided by 2 is 0, then we know that x is *even*, and the program\n",
    "displays an appropriate message. It prints *odd* otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the condition must be True or False, exactly one of the two alternatives will run. The\n",
    "alternatives are called **branches**, because they are branches in the flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the `else:` clause that introduces the alternative block/branch to run.\n"
