    "# Some questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we discuss some simple questions and exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find a numerical binary encoding (that minimizes the number of bits used) of the following list of judgements: \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>'very low' \n",
    "<li>'low' \n",
    "<li>'medium'\n",
    "<li>'high'\n",
    "<li>'very high'\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "We aim at maintaning the judgement ordering in the encoding.\n",
    "> Since the elements are $5$, we need $3$ bits to represent the values ($2^3$ possible encodings). \n",
    "Indeed, if we need to encode $n$ values, we need at least $\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ bits. A possible encoding that maintains the relative ordering is the following:\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "$000 \\rightarrow$ 'very low', $001 \\rightarrow$ 'low',  $010 \\rightarrow$ 'medium', $011 \\rightarrow$ 'high', and $100 \\rightarrow$  'very high'. The other $3$ of $8$ configurations ($101$, $110$, $111$) are unused. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note that the numerical relationships $<$, $>$, $=$ between the numerical codes match the ordering of the original judgements. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. How many characters can be represented in 1 GB (Giga Bytes)?\n",
    "> The answer depends on the encoding length per character. First, 1 KB corresponds to $2^{10}$ bytes (1024, about 1000).\n",
    "1 MB corresponds to $2^{20}$ bytes, which is about 1 million bytes. So, if we use ASCII code, where each character is encoded as a single byte, we can represent a text of about 1 Billion characters (1 GB = $2^{30}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the value of a digit, represented in positional notation in base $B$ as a sequence of 5 symbols: $d_4 d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0$?\n",
    "> $\\sum_{1=0}^4 d_i \\cdot B^i  \\ \\ \\ \\ = \\ \\ \\ \\ d_0 \\cdot B^0 + d_1 \\cdot B^1 + d_2 \\cdot B^2 + d_3 \\cdot B^3 + d_4 \\cdot B^4 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of the binary digit $101011$?\n",
    "> $1 + 2 + 8 + 32 = 43$. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Why programming languages are *formal languages*?\n",
    "> Because they adopt strict syntax rules, concerning the tokens of the language, the operators allowed,  and the structure. The final goal is to avoid ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the main difference among high-level language, assembly language, and machine language? Relate the answer to the the concept of abstraction. \n",
    "> The machine languages is at the lowest level of abstraction. It is composed of the base instructions (e.g., arithmetic operations) that a CPU can interpret, and are **binary encoded**.\n",
    "The assembly language concerns the mnemonic representation of machine instructions, and so it is placed at an higher level of abstraction.\n",
    "High-level languages make *easier* to program computers, since they *abstract* from the specific machine language instruction set, thanks to a compiler or interpreter (a special software that translate from a given high-level language into a specific machine language).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the *control flow* of a program. For example, what does it happen when an `if` statement is executed, or a *function* is called.\n",
    "> The *control flow* is the order in which the individual statements of a program are executed. Normally, the instruction are executed following the ordered sequencing of successive commands.\n",
    "When the control flow of the program arrives at executing an `if` statement, the control flow can follow either the 1st or the 2nd branch (`else`), depending on the Boolean result of the corresponding test. When we call a function, the control flow jumps to the first statement of the called function, and upon return, the control flow comes back to resume the calling program from where it left off.\n",
    " \n",
    "8. The process of *digitization* requires to *discretise* a signal (analog signalÂ sampled at regular time intervals) and to *quantise* (samples transformed into a fixed set of numbers of a given length). Why we can loose quality when we digitise an analog signal?\n",
    "> The quality reduction happens when the intervals of sampling are too long and the prescribed set of discrete values for quantising is too small.\n",
    "The number of pixels of a digital images is related to the discretization of the original image (less pixels imply lower quality), while the bits used to quantise each pixel allows for storing the pixel colors (less bits imply lower quality). "

    "> Supposing that a user inputs first '22' and then '22'. Since the numbers are stored as string in *program 1*, then the operand **+** concatenates the two strings, and thus the final output is the string '2222'.\n",
    "In case of *program 1*, the two strings are first transformed into two integer values, in turn stored as  binary numbers, on which arithmetic operations can be applied. Then the operand **+** sums the two integers, and thus the output is '44' (indeed, the string '44', produced by function `print()`."

    "Given a list referenced by a variable `var_l`, \n",
    "the list method `var_l.insert(i, x)` inserts an item `x` at a given position `i`, increasing the length of the list by one. The first argument `i` is thus the index of the (old) element before which to insert  `x`. Note that `var_l.insert(len(var_l), x)` is equivalent to appending `x` to the end of the list `var_l`.\n",

    "We have to write a function that inserts a number in a list of integers, sorted in ascending ordering, by keeping the list sorted. \n",
