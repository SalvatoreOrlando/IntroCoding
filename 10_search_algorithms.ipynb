    "## Linear search\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several variants of the same **linear search** algorithm, besides the one shown above. \n",

    "For example, we could have used ```range()``` and made the loop run only over the indexes.\n",

    "                if xs[i] == target:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **essential similarity** in all these variations is that we test *every item in the list in turn*, from first to last, and return as soon as we find the target.\n",
    "This kind of search is called a **linear search**. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we call **probe** each test ```(v == target)```, we can think of the **count of the probes** as an **efficiency measure** of our algorithm (how long our algorithm will take to execute), because these probes are the main and most expensive operation performed for each item of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear search** is characterized by the fact that the number of probes we need to find a target depends directly on the **length of the list**. In particular, if we search for a target that is not present in the list, we need **N probes**, where **N is the length of the list**.\n",

    "# Binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear search algorithm is good, but it becomes **very bad** when the **list is sorted**, for example in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the method you use if you were given a vocabulary and asked to tell if some word was present. You'd probably start in the middle. So you can probe *some word in the middle page*,\n",
    "and immediately realize that your target was before (or perhaps after) the one you had probed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this principle repeatedly leads us to a very much better algorithm for searching in a\n",
    "list of items that are already ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if at a given step of the process we have that ```lb``` and ```ub``` are the lower/upper bounds of the **list's slice of interest**, this means that our search is limited within  ```list[lb:ub]```, where the length of the slice ```list[lb:ub]``` is exactly ```(ub-lb)``` *(note that the element of index* ```ub``` *is not included in the slice)*. The binary (or bisection) search works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, select the *midpoint* of the sorted list, i.e., ```list[mid]```, where<br/>  ```mid = (ub+lb) // 2```.  *(note the integer divison)* \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If this midpoint is **equal to** the target element, we have found the item and then we **stop the search**.  Otherwise, we check if our target is *less or greater* than the midpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the target is **less than** the midpoint, since the list is sorted in *ascending order*, the target element may be located on the *\"left segment\"*: ```list[lb:mid]``` *(note that the element of index ```mid``` is not included in the slice)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the target is **greater than** the midpoint, the target element may be located on the *\"right segment\"*: ```list[mid+1:ub]```. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have to update ```ub``` if we select the *\"left segment\"*, and ```lb``` if we select the *\"right segment\"*, and then **repeat** the steps 1-4 on the shortened list.\n",
    "It is worth notice that for each probe against a midpoint, we **halve** the size of the list slice in which we search for the target: this is the **algorithmic trick** that makes this algorithm so efficient.\n",

    "### Complexity of binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "The word binary means two. Binary search gets its name from the fact that each probe splits the list into two pieces and discards the one half from the region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of the algorithm is that we could **double the size $N$** of the list (the vocabulary in our case), and it would only need **one more probe**! And after another doubling, just another one probe, and so on.\n",
    "*So as the vocabulary gets bigger, this algorithm’s performance becomes even more impressive.*\n",
    "\n",
    "With 1 probe, we can only search a list of size 1 ($= 2^1-1$). With two probes we could cope with lists up\n",
    "to size 3 ($= 2^2-1$):  test the middle item with the first probe, then test either the left or right sublist with the second probe. With one more probe, we could cope with 7 ($= 2^3-1$) items: the middle item, and two sublists of size 3. With four probes, we can search 15 ($= 2^4-1$) items, and 5 probes lets us search up to 31 ($= 2^5 -1$) items. So the general relationship is given by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\ \\ N = 2^k - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the number of probes we are allowed to make, and $N$ is the maximum size of the list\n",
    "that can be searched in that many probes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we are interested in knowing $k$ as a function of N:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\ \\ k = \\lceil \\log_2 (N + 1)  \\rceil$\n",
    "\n",
    "The *ceiling brackets* round the number up to the next whole integer, when $N+1$ is not a perfect power of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Computer scientists* say that the **complexity** of *binary search* is $O(\\log N)$, where $N$ is the size of problem (usually the number of elements).\n",
    "It is a theoretical measure of the execution time of an algorithm as a function of $N$. Very roughly speeking,  if we say that an algorithm has computational complexity $f(N) = O(\\log N)$ (\"$f$ of $N$ is *big oh* of $\\log N$\"), it means that the complexity measure $f(N)$ has a trend similar to function $\\log N$.\n",
